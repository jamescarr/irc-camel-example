IRC Javascript Evaluator Example
--------------------------------
Just a simple example of using camel to receive a message from an irc based endpoint, parse it through a javascript ScriptEngine, and send the result back to the irc endpoint. 

Requires JAVA_HOME to be set to a java6 SDK. Won't work on anything else because I wrote this quick and on the fly

Starting
--------
From the command line type 
 mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=org.jamescarr.camel.App

Usage
-----
By default it creates a bot named js-bot and drops it in #botwar on irc.freenode.net. To test it, join irc.freenode.net/#botwar and type

?eval [some javascript snippet]

for example:
?eval (function(n){ return n==1?n:n*arguments.callee(n-1)})(5)
